# Hello, I'm Gore! 👋 

## A Chef-turned-Frontend Developer Crafting Tasty Digital Experiences
<p>Passionate and creative frontend developer with a knack for designing visually compelling and user-friendly interfaces. With 2 years of experience in the tech industry, I leverage my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, to hand-craft solutions that are as stunning as they are functional.</p>
<p>Coming from a background as a Chef, I bring a unique approach to development. I treat every project like a culinary masterpiece, where the right mix of simple ingredients leads to a sensory feast that leaves a lasting impression. Whether it's crafting a dish or a website, my creativity and attention to detail are what set me apart.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I've had the pleasure of working with top-tier clients and have been instrumental in driving large-scale projects. From creating engaging user experiences at MediaNews Group to providing high-quality instructional support at General Assembly, my diverse experiences have honed my ability to deliver and exceed expectations.
